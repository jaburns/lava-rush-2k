### Building
Currently only Windows is supported by the build system, but versions of the binary dependencies exist for other operating systems.
```
npm install
npm run 2k       # builds 2k version, including zip file
npm run plus     # builds plus version without zipping
npm run pluszip  # builds plus version and creates zip bundle
npm start        # starts a server for testing the plus build at localhost:3000
```
